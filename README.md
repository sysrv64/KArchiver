# KArchiver

Android file manager built around archives: browse storage, open archives without extracting, edit ZIP/TAR/7Z in place, and search inside files and archives. The UI is Jetpack Compose (Material 3 Expressive); all archive work is done by a Rust core over JNI. Android 8.0+ (API 26), arm64-v8a / x86_64, no internet permission.

## Features

- Storage browser: volumes (internal / SD / USB), list and grid, sorting, hidden files, multi-select, copy / cut / paste, favorites, storage usage carousel.
- Customizable navigation drawer: hold and drag a tab to reorder it, hold a tab to remove it, hold the empty area under the tabs to add a tab back.
- Recents: the newest files and folders from every storage volume in one list.
- Archive explorer: browse ZIP, 7Z, TAR family and RAR without extracting; in-place add, rename and delete for ZIP, TAR family and 7Z.
- Copy and extract with conflict handling: replace, skip, or keep both (`name (1).ext`).
- Long operations run in a foreground service with progress, speed, ETA, cancel and a stall watchdog.
- Search by name, extension, date, size and type, plus `content:` for file or entry contents and `archive:` for entry names inside archives.
- File properties: permissions, rename, and modified date with a Material 3 date picker.
- Optional Trash: deleted files are moved aside instead of erased, with restore, delete forever and empty Trash from the drawer.
- Optional Shizuku or root engine for restricted paths, SAF fallback when All files access is denied.
- Optional system browsing (off by default): go above internal storage into `/`, `/data`, `/data/data`, `/vendor`, `/system` and other users' storage. Root is required for `/data` and app data.
- Optional history of visited folders and files in a local Room database.

## Build

Needs JDK 17, Android SDK with `compileSdk 37` and build-tools 37.0.0, NDK 28.2.13676358, Rust 1.98.1 (`rust/rust-toolchain.toml`) and `cargo-ndk`.

```bash
cargo install cargo-ndk
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android x86_64-linux-android

cd rust
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -t x86_64 --platform 26 -o ../app/src/main/jniLibs build --lib
cd ..
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

APK: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. Tests:

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
cd rust && cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

## CI, releases and signing

`.github/workflows/build.yml` builds on pushes to `main`, on pull requests, and on demand. Debug APKs are signed with a throwaway keystore generated for every run; release APKs and app bundles (AAB) are built only on pushes and signed with the keystore kept in repository secrets. Signing material is read from `KARCHIVER_*` environment variables, so nothing secret is committed, and pull requests never touch it. The run summary lists the size and SHA-256 of each artifact.

APKs are available in two places: as workflow artifacts under Actions, and attached to tagged versions on the [Releases](https://github.com/sysrv64/KArchiver/releases) page. Release entries list the file names, sizes and SHA-256 values.
